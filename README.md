# Python Performance Comparison: CPython vs. PyPy

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the performance differences between the standard Python interpreter (CPython) and PyPy, an alternative Python interpreter with Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation. The task chosen for this comparison is the calculation of the first N prime numbers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (CPython)
- PyPy

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RimshaT1610/python-pypy-speed-comparison.git
   cd your-repo-name
2. Ensure you have both CPython and PyPy installed on your system
3. **Running the Script**
    Using CPython:
    '''bash
    python speed_test.py 1000000
    Using PyPy
    python speed_test.py 1000000
